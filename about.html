    <h2>About Me: </h2>

    <p>I am from Senegal which is a small country in western Africa. In 2016, I was selected to study in Red Cross Nordic UWC which is</p>
    <p>one of the 18 United World Colleges in the world. This school is in the commune of Fjaler, in Norway. I graduated from Red Cross 
    <p>Nordic UWC in 2018 with an international baccalaureate.</p>
    <p>In Fall 2018, I came to the University of Oklahoma and decided to pursue a major in management Information Systems. Last Fall semester,</p> 
    <p>I joined the accelerated MS-MIT program and I planning to graduate in May 2022. I am also a member of the International advisory committee</p> 
    <p>at the University of Oklahoma. </p>
